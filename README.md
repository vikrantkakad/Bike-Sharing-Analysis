In this analysis, we will use the bike sharing dataset. The data set derived from the "UCI Machine Learning Repository".
The data is related to the capital of washigton D.C. USA ridership with two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012.
We chose this dataset because bike sharing service, the new evolution of bike rentals, has become popular for recent few years.
It is systems are the new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic.
In this analysis, we want to predict the ridership based on other factors like weather, season, holidays etc.
